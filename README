NEON README UPDATED: DEC 2012
=====================================
Neon is a project which is still
in development. The intent of neon
is to be a fully usable control panel
for servers with multiple user support
and to offer easy to use tools for
building and maintaining websites.

SETUP DIRECTIONS UNTIL FULL INSTALL EXISTS
==========================================
cd $HOME;
wget https://raw.github.com/BlueVM/Neon/develop/neon-installer.sh
chmod 777 neon-installer.sh

1. Create a database and a user via mysql,
use the data.sql file to populate the database.
Update the table settings, set the default_ip
to your servers IP. 

2. Edit config.json to match your new
your database settings and add a random
salt key string (12+ characters is better).
The config.json file is in: /var/neon/data/
